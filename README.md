## description

in this project it is a back end app that allows people to keep track of employees, roles, jobs, and managers by answering a series of prompts after doing an npm start.
this project will help buisnesses by being able to add delete and view their emplyees their managers and so much more at the click of a button.

## how to use

 to use this application you need to first have access to my github page from there you clone the repository to your local device and run it in your terminal.
 from there you source the seeds schema and db to make sure everything is running properly then from there you start the npm start to get the server running and the prompts to appear.

 ## issues
 unfortunately i wasnt able to get the code up and running i was able to source my schema seeds and db and things seemed to be running smoothly until i started to do an npm start and kept running into errors. i had the prompts and everything written out but cant get it to appear when doing the start. ive tried changing the type to commonjs and module and tried changing the syntax and updating mysql but nothing seemed to be working.
